# Orchestrator Refactoring - Summary

## 📋 Documents Overview

I've created three comprehensive documents for the orchestrator refactoring:

1. **ORCHESTRATOR_REFACTORING_PLAN.md** - Detailed technical plan with architecture, migration strategy, and timeline
2. **ORCHESTRATOR_DESIGN.md** - Visual overview with diagrams comparing current vs. proposed approach
3. **ORCHESTRATOR_CODE_EXAMPLES.md** - Concrete code examples for all new components

## 🎯 Core Concept

**Transform JediMaster from hardcoded sequential processing to intelligent LLM-based orchestration.**

### Current Problem
```python
# Today: Blindly process everything in fixed order
for issue in all_issues:
    decide(issue)  # LLM call
    
for pr in all_prs:
    decide(pr)     # LLM call
    
create_new_issues()  # LLM call
```

**Issues:**
- No prioritization (stale items wait behind new ones)
- No resource awareness (may hit rate limits)
- No strategic thinking (creates issues even when overwhelmed)
- Inefficient (many small LLM calls)

### Proposed Solution
```python
# New: Intelligent orchestration
state = analyze_repo()           # Fast, no LLM
resources = check_rate_limits()  # Fast, no LLM
plan = orchestrator.plan(state, resources)  # ONE LLM call

for workflow in plan.workflows:
    execute(workflow)  # Targeted execution
```

**Benefits:**
- Smart prioritization (quick wins first)
- Resource-aware (respects API limits)
- Strategic decisions (adapts to repo state)
- Efficient (one planning call + targeted work)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Three-Tier Design

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Orchestrator Agent (LLM)          │
│   Strategic planning & decisions     │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │         │         
┌───▼───┐ ┌──▼──────┐ ┌──▼──────┐
│Analyze│ │ Decide  │ │ Execute │
│(fast) │ │ (LLM)   │ │ (API)   │
└───────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘
```

**Tier 1: Analytical Agents** (No LLM, Fast)
- RepoStateAnalyzer - Count issues/PRs by state
- ResourceMonitor - Check GitHub API limits
- WorkloadPrioritizer - Sort by urgency

**Tier 2: Orchestrator** (One LLM Call)
- Analyzes state
- Makes strategic decisions
- Creates execution plan

**Tier 3: Action Agents** (Existing Code)
- IssueProcessor - Uses existing `process_issue()`
- PRManager - Uses existing `_process_pr_state_machine()`
- IssueCreator - Uses existing `CreatorAgent`

## 📊 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Overwhelmed Repository
```
State:
- 50 issues (40 unprocessed, 10 stale)
- 20 PRs (5 ready to merge, 10 pending review)
- API quota: 500/5000 (low)

Orchestrator Decision:
✓ merge_ready_prs (5)  - Quick wins
✓ cleanup_stale (10)   - Reduce clutter
✗ SKIP review_prs      - Not enough quota
✗ SKIP process_issues  - Backlog too high
✗ SKIP create_issues   - Already overwhelmed

Result: Reduced backlog 15 items without creating more
```

### Scenario 2: Healthy Repository
```
State:
- 5 issues (3 new, 2 assigned to Copilot)
- 3 PRs (1 ready to merge, 2 pending review)
- API quota: 4800/5000 (good)

Orchestrator Decision:
✓ merge_ready_prs (1)
✓ review_prs (2)
✓ process_issues (3)
✓ create_issues (3)    - Backlog healthy

Result: Cleared backlog + created new work
```

## 🔧 What Changes

### NEW Code (Add)
```
agents/
├── orchestrator.py              # NEW: Main orchestrator
├── analytical/
│   ├── repo_state_analyzer.py   # NEW: State analysis
│   ├── resource_monitor.py      # NEW: Rate limit tracking
│   └── workload_prioritizer.py  # NEW: Priority sorting
core/
└── models.py                     # NEW: Data structures
```

### MODIFIED Code (Minimal)
```
jedimaster.py
└── Add orchestrated_run() method  # NEW method only

example.py  
└── Add --orchestrate flag         # NEW flag only

function_app.py
└── Add ENABLE_ORCHESTRATION       # NEW env var only
```

### UNCHANGED Code (Keep)
```
✓ All PR state detection logic
✓ All PR metadata collection
✓ All state machine handlers
✓ DeciderAgent, PRDeciderAgent, CreatorAgent
✓ All GitHub operations
✓ All existing workflows
```

## 🚀 Migration Path

### Phase 1: Build (Weeks 1-2)
- Create analytical agents
- Create orchestrator agent
- Add `orchestrated_run()` method
- **Result**: New code alongside existing, nothing broken

### Phase 2: Test (Week 3)
- Manual testing with `--orchestrate` flag
- Compare outcomes vs. old approach
- Tune LLM prompts
- **Result**: Validated approach, ready for opt-in

### Phase 3: Opt-In (Week 4-5)
- Deploy to Azure Functions
- Enable `ENABLE_ORCHESTRATION=1` for test repos
- Monitor and validate
- **Result**: Production validation, gathering data

### Phase 4: Default (Week 6+)
- Make orchestration default
- Keep old flow as fallback
- **Result**: Improved efficiency, reduced waste

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Keep All Existing Logic
**Decision**: Don't change any PR/issue state detection logic
**Reason**: It's working correctly, refactor is about orchestration only

### 2. Opt-In Initially
**Decision**: New `--orchestrate` flag, old behavior default
**Reason**: Safe migration, easy rollback, side-by-side comparison

### 3. One Orchestration LLM Call
**Decision**: Single planning call, not per-item calls
**Reason**: Efficiency - strategic decisions are cheaper than tactical ones

### 4. Reuse Existing Agents
**Decision**: Keep DeciderAgent, PRDeciderAgent, CreatorAgent unchanged
**Reason**: They work well, orchestrator just decides when to use them

### 5. Resource-Aware by Default
**Decision**: Always check API limits before planning
**Reason**: Prevent rate limit issues, smarter resource usage

## 📈 Success Metrics

Track these to validate the refactoring:

1. **API Efficiency**: Calls per item processed (expect 30-50% reduction)
2. **Backlog Reduction**: Time to clear backlog (expect 40% faster)
3. **LLM Cost**: Cost per repo run (expect 60-80% reduction)
4. **Quick Wins**: PRs merged per run (expect 2x more quick wins)
5. **Stale Rate**: Items that go stale (expect 50% reduction)

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| LLM makes poor decisions | Guardrails in prompt, logging, override flags |
| Added complexity | Clean separation, opt-in, detailed docs |
| Slower execution | Only one LLM call, fast analytical agents |
| Migration issues | Keep old code, gradual rollout, easy rollback |

## 🎓 Learning & Adaptation

The orchestrator can learn over time:

1. **Track Outcomes**: Log what plans worked well
2. **Measure Impact**: Calculate health score before/after
3. **Adapt Prompts**: Tune based on successful strategies
4. **Share Knowledge**: Multi-repo insights inform decisions

## 📝 Next Steps

### Before Implementation
1. **Review Documents**: Read all three planning docs
2. **Discuss Design**: Any concerns or suggestions?
3. **Validate Approach**: Does this solve the right problem?
4. **Confirm Scope**: Keep existing logic unchanged?

### To Start Implementation
1. **Create Data Models**: `core/models.py` first
2. **Build Analytical Agents**: Fast, no LLM
3. **Implement Orchestrator**: LLM-based planning
4. **Add Integration Point**: `orchestrated_run()` method
5. **Test & Validate**: Compare vs. existing approach

## 🤔 Open Questions

Please provide feedback on:

1. **Architecture**: Is three-tier design appropriate?
2. **Workflows**: Right granularity (merge/review/process/create/cleanup)?
3. **Migration**: Opt-in forever or eventually default?
4. **State Logic**: Confirm keeping ALL existing state detection?
5. **Resources**: Should we also track Copilot's rate limits?
6. **Multi-Repo**: Should orchestrator handle multiple repos in one plan?
7. **Prompt Tuning**: How do we measure and improve orchestrator decisions?
