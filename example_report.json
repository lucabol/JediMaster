      "title": "Create a plugin system for extending hello.c functionality",
      "url": "https://github.com/lucabol/Hello-World/issues/390",
      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot. It involves architectural design and implementation of a plugin system, which requires significant planning and decision-making beyond just writing code. Copilot is better suited for concrete coding tasks like writing functions, classes, or algorithms.",

      "url": "https://github.com/lucabol/Hello-World/issues/389",
      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot. Voice-driven code editing involves complex natural language processing and integration with speech recognition technologies, which are beyond the capabilities of Copilot. It requires extensive domain knowledge in speech recognition and user interface design, making it unsuitable for automated code generation or assistance.",

      "url": "https://github.com/lucabol/Hello-World/issues/388",
      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot as it involves a feature request for enabling real-time collaborative editing, which is more about project architecture and real-time communication implementation rather than specific coding tasks. It requires complex synchronization, conflict resolution, and user interface considerations that go beyond the capabilities of code generation or improvement that Copilot can provide.",

      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is suitable for GitHub Copilot. It involves concrete coding tasks such as creating a spreadsheet tool, analyzing code metrics, and displaying them in a tabular format. Copilot can assist in generating the necessary functions, classes, and logic for implementing the spreadsheet-like interface for code metrics.",

      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot. Integrating a visual block-based editor involves complex frontend development, interaction design, and potentially backend integration. It requires expertise in web technologies, UI/UX design, and possibly compiler integration, which are beyond the scope of code generation or improvement tasks that Copilot excels at.",

      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is suitable for GitHub Copilot as it involves a clear and specific coding task: replacing the usage of printf with puts in a C file. Copilot can assist in generating the appropriate code change, which falls under code improvement and refactoring.",

      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is suitable for GitHub Copilot because it involves a clear coding task: modifying the hello.c program to print the return value of main before exiting. Copilot can assist in adding the necessary code to achieve this task, such as retrieving the return value and printing it to the console.",

      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is suitable for GitHub Copilot. It involves a clear coding task of adding a function to print a custom message in hello.c. Copilot can assist in writing the function, handling the argument passing, and ensuring the code follows best practices for modularity and readability.",
