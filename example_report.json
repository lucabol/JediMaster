      "title": "Create a plugin system for extending hello.c functionality",
      "url": "https://github.com/lucabol/Hello-World/issues/349",
      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot. It involves designing and implementing a plugin system, which requires architectural decisions and planning rather than direct coding tasks. GitHub Copilot is better suited for concrete coding tasks like writing functions, classes, or algorithms, rather than high-level design and architecture work.",

      "url": "https://github.com/lucabol/Hello-World/issues/348",
      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot. It involves implementing a voice-driven code editing feature, which is a complex task requiring specialized knowledge in speech recognition, natural language processing, and user interface design. Copilot is designed for assisting with concrete coding tasks like code generation, refactoring, and testing, rather than implementing advanced features like voice-driven editing.",

      "url": "https://github.com/lucabol/Hello-World/issues/347",
      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot as it involves implementing real-time collaborative editing functionality, which is a complex task requiring synchronization, conflict resolution, and potentially a deep understanding of networking and concurrency. This goes beyond the scope of code generation or refactoring that Copilot excels at, and it requires significant domain knowledge in collaborative editing systems.",

      "status": "labeled",
      "reasoning": "This issue is suitable for GitHub Copilot. It involves concrete coding tasks such as creating a spreadsheet tool, analyzing code metrics, and displaying them in a tabular format. Copilot can assist in generating the necessary functions, classes, and logic for implementing the spreadsheet-like interface for code metrics.",

      "url": "https://github.com/lucabol/Hello-World/issues/345",
      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot. Integrating a visual block-based editor involves significant UI/UX design and frontend development work, which is beyond the scope of Copilot's capabilities. Copilot excels at code generation, refactoring, documentation, and testing tasks, but it is not designed for tasks that require extensive user interface implementation or design decisions.",

      "status": "labeled",
      "reasoning": "This issue is suitable for GitHub Copilot as it involves a clear and specific coding task: replacing the usage of printf with puts in a C file. Copilot can assist in generating the necessary code changes and provide guidance on the syntax and usage of the puts function.",

      "status": "labeled",
      "reasoning": "This issue is suitable for GitHub Copilot as it involves code improvement and refactoring. Copilot can assist in adding a function to hello.c that prints a custom message passed as an argument, which falls within the scope of code generation and implementation tasks.",
