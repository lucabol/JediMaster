      "url": "https://github.com/lucabol/Hello-World/issues/540",
      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot as it involves architectural design and implementation of a plugin system, which requires significant planning and decision-making beyond just writing code. It also involves defining interfaces, communication protocols, and potentially complex integration logic, which are not straightforward coding tasks that Copilot can assist with.",

      "url": "https://github.com/lucabol/Hello-World/issues/539",
      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot. Voice-driven code editing involves complex natural language processing and integration with voice recognition technologies, which are beyond the capabilities of Copilot. It requires specialized domain knowledge in speech recognition and user interface design, making it unsuitable for automated code generation or assistance.",

      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot. It involves implementing real-time collaborative editing functionality, which is a complex task requiring synchronization, conflict resolution, and network communication. This goes beyond code generation or refactoring and involves significant architectural decisions and considerations about user experience and real-time communication protocols, which are not within the scope of GitHub Copilot's capabilities.",

      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is suitable for GitHub Copilot. It involves implementing a spreadsheet-like interface for code metrics, which includes tasks such as creating new functions, classes, and modules to analyze code metrics, generating interactive tabular displays, and potentially implementing algorithms for metric calculations. Copilot can assist in writing the necessary code for this task.",
