      "url": "https://github.com/lucabol/Hello-World/issues/626",
      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot as it involves architectural design and implementation of a plugin system, which requires significant planning and decision-making beyond just writing code. It also involves defining interfaces, communication protocols, and potentially complex interactions, which are not straightforward coding tasks that Copilot can assist with.",

      "url": "https://github.com/lucabol/Hello-World/issues/625",
      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot. Voice-driven code editing involves complex natural language processing and integration with speech recognition technologies, which are beyond the capabilities of Copilot. It requires extensive domain knowledge in speech recognition and user interface design, making it unsuitable for automated code generation or assistance.",

      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot. It involves implementing real-time collaborative editing functionality, which is a complex task requiring synchronization, conflict resolution, and network communication. This goes beyond code generation or refactoring and involves significant architectural decisions and considerations, making it unsuitable for automated assistance.",

      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot. Integrating a visual block-based editor involves complex frontend development, interaction design, and potentially parsing C code from visual blocks. This task requires expertise in web development and UI/UX design, which is beyond the scope of GitHub Copilot's capabilities. Additionally, the task involves creating a visual editor tool, which is not a typical coding task that Copilot can assist with.",
