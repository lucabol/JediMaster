      "url": "https://github.com/lucabol/Hello-World/issues/580",
      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot as it involves architectural design and implementation of a plugin system, which requires significant planning and decision-making beyond just writing code. It also involves defining interfaces, communication protocols, and potentially complex integration logic, which are not straightforward coding tasks that Copilot can assist with.",

      "url": "https://github.com/lucabol/Hello-World/issues/579",
      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot. Adding support for voice-driven code editing involves complex integration with speech recognition APIs, natural language processing, and user interface design, which require extensive domain knowledge and are not typical coding tasks. Copilot is better suited for tasks involving code generation, refactoring, documentation, testing, and bug fixes.",

      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot as it involves implementing real-time collaborative editing functionality, which is a complex task requiring synchronization, conflict resolution, and network communication. This goes beyond the capabilities of code generation or refactoring that Copilot excels at, as it involves significant architectural decisions and considerations beyond just writing code.",

      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot. Integrating a visual block-based editor involves UI/UX design, frontend development, and potentially complex interactions between the visual blocks and the underlying C code. This task requires expertise in web technologies, user interface design, and integration with the C codebase, which goes beyond the capabilities of GitHub Copilot that focuses on code generation, refactoring, documentation, and testing.",
