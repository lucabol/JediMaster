      "url": "https://github.com/lucabol/Hello-World/issues/676",
      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot as it involves architectural design and implementation of a plugin system, which requires significant planning and decision-making beyond just writing code. It also involves defining interfaces, communication mechanisms, and potentially complex interactions, which are not straightforward coding tasks that Copilot can assist with.",

      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot. The task of adding support for voice-driven code editing involves complex integration with speech recognition APIs, natural language processing, and user interface design, which require extensive domain knowledge and are not typical coding tasks that Copilot can assist with.",

      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot. It involves implementing real-time collaborative editing functionality, which is a complex task requiring synchronization, conflict resolution, and user interface considerations. Copilot is best suited for code generation, refactoring, documentation, testing, bug fixes, and integration tasks, rather than building real-time collaborative editing features.",

      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot. Integrating a visual block-based editor involves complex UI/UX design and implementation, which requires human judgment and extensive domain knowledge in user interface interactions. Copilot is more suited for tasks involving code generation, refactoring, documentation, testing, bug fixes, and integration/configuration, rather than UI design and implementation.",
