      "status": "not_assigned",
      "reasoning": "This issue is not suitable for GitHub Copilot. It involves architectural design and implementation of a plugin system, which requires high-level decision-making, understanding of software architecture, and potentially complex integration. Copilot is better suited for concrete coding tasks like writing functions, classes, or algorithms, rather than designing and implementing a plugin system.",
